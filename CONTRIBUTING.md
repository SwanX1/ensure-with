### So... you've decided to contribute to this repository.
Thank you! It may not seem like much, but it does to me.

**I am accepting new features to this tool!**<br>
Yes, that's right! You can be the author of your very own feature in this tool, given it's meaningful and qualitative enough, of course.

This project contains no dependencies (except for prettier and eslint for development), and I'd like to keep it that way.

Pull Requests will be judged on a case-by-case basis, so feel free to spread your wings with the format and style of yours!
